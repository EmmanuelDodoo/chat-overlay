# ChatGPT Overlay

## Description

The Desktop Overlay for ChatGPT is a versatile application built with Tauri that provides a convenient and seamless interface for interacting with ChatGPT without using the web browser. It enhances the user experience by offering features such as a smooth interface, portability, conversation thread switching, user switching, and response regeneration. The ultimate goal of the project is to allow users to overlay ChatGPT on any website of their choice, expanding its usability beyond the confines of a single application.

## Planned Features/ Goals:

- **Smooth Interface**: The application offers a polished and intuitive interface, ensuring a seamless user experience while interacting with ChatGPT.

- **Portability**: The Desktop Overlay for ChatGPT is designed to be portable, allowing users to easily run the application on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Conversation Thread Switching**: Users can switch between different conversation threads, making it convenient to manage and engage in multiple ongoing conversations.

- **User Switching**: The application supports the ability to change users, enabling users to switch between different identities or personas while interacting with ChatGPT.

- **Response Regeneration**: Users have the option to regenerate responses from ChatGPT, allowing them to refine or explore different outcomes based on their preferences or requirements.

- **Overlay Any Website**: In the long-term vision, the application aims to provide the functionality to overlay ChatGPT on any website of the user's choice. This feature would enable users to seamlessly integrate ChatGPT into their preferred online environments.
